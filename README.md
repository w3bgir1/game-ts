# Typescript Exercise

### Intro

Next week we'll start to work on some multiplayer games in Typescript. To get into the vibe, this homework is to make sure you understand all the parts of your REST API and to recap the work we did in Typescript. 

We will evaluate you on functionality but also on general delivery and code quality. Make sure your repo contains the stuff it needs to contain and your code is DRY. 

### Step-by-step instructions

These are the steps to create a basic backend (API-only):

1. Create a `games` table with model using TypeORM. A game should have an `id`, a `name`, a `color` and `board` field. Both the name and color fields are `text` fields, the board field is of type `json`.  
2. Setup a webserver using routing-controllers and create a `GET /games` endpoint that returns all the games (with envelope!)
3. Add an endpoint `POST /games` for which the only input is a name. The created game should receive a random color out of these colors: red, blue, green, yellow, magenta. So every new game that gets created is assigned a random color. 
4. Add an endpoint `PUT /games/:id` or `PATCH /games/:id` that allows to overwrite one or more fields of the game. E.g. calling `PUT /games` with JSON body `{ "name": "new name" }` should update the name, same for color and board (not for id). 
5. When a **game is changed** using the endpoint you made in #4 and the color field is updated, make sure (validate) that the color is one of these colors: red, blue, green, yellow, magenta
6. When a **game starts**, your app should set the board to an empty board. The board is a two dimensional array that contains three arrays with three times the letter 'o'. (see code below\*)
7. When a **game is changed** and the board field is updated, make sure only 1 move is made per request. That means that only one element out of the 9 can be changed into something else. You can use the function below to count the number of moves between two boards. If somebody tries to make more moves, return a `HTTP 400 Bad Request` response. If everything is fine, update the board field of the game.  \*\* 


\* the start position of the board in code:

```ts
const defaultBoard = [
	['o', 'o', 'o'],
	['o', 'o', 'o'],
	['o', 'o', 'o']
]
``` 

\*\* a function that returns the number of changes between boards

```ts
const moves = (board1, board2) => 
  board1
    .map((row, y) => row.filter((cell, x) => board2[y][x] !== cell))
    .reduce((a, b) => a.concat(b))
    .length
```
